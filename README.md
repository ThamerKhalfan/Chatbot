The following prototype chat bot is designed to increase customer retention and contact with a bookstore during these difficult Covid filled times. It designed regroup most of our customer requests for popular British and Russian literature works in two separate categories and deliver them info on the availability of works by the authors they are searching for at our shop. Using basic intents such as #Russian_Literature, #Dosteyvsky and #hours to meet customer demands. Coupled with entities such as @Autthor_Tolkien to match individuals looking for certain books with responses that contain keywords such as genres (eg: fantasy) or book titles (eg: Return of the King). By combining this with or sys_date function we are able to return book availability to customers at our shop and the hours at which we are open for them to execute a click and collect purchase.
